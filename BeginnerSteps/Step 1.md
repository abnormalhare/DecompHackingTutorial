## Step 1: Important Resources
##### It's important to have a few things before we get started, so I'll make a list here:
- Mario 64 for both US and JP
  - US doesn't have all the textures, and we all know how you obtained your ROM before.
- Blender v3.1: https://www.blender.org/download/
  - Blender is a very useful (but somewhat difficult) tool that is great for making level models and compatible with the next few things on the list.

If you are on Linux, the next point don't apply to you.
- WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
  - This is kind of stupid, but the next point only works with this.

> Before moving on (Windows), make sure to set up your Unix username and password:  
1\. Open Windows Terminal (Admin) by right-clicking your Windows Icon.  
2\. Open a new Ubuntu tab by clicking the arrow by the plus sign.  
3\. Type in `sudo`, and popup will ask for your Unix username and password.  

- HackerSM64: https://github.com/HackerN64/HackerSM64
  - This is decomp. Make sure to put this in your /home/<user> (or anywhere you want on Linux) file or else  things might get a little weird.
- Fast64: https://github.com/Fast-64/fast64
  - This allows you to connect Blender to HackerSM64. **Make sure to download as a ZIP file**
- Someone2639's Base Model: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/701163914775494656/759578327181688842/Fast64_Template_2.9_by_someone2639_1.blend
  - This gives you a jump start. Make sure to open it in Blender
- A good podcast: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtiWkKVZkCXVu_3pkKsQviOZ7r_9b39JN
  - Putting this in the background helps you concentrate and relax when working to not cause too much stress on you :)
