## Step 4: Blender Tools and Shortcuts
Now that you're through all that set up and preparation, let's get you making a 3D model. There are 2 different ways to make polygons, with different uses:
1. Poly Build. Located on the right when in edit mode, just above the pie chart looking thing (Spin).  
-- Pros: It helps create the triangles we need really easily. Hover near the edge of a previously made object and press `Ctrl`. A triangle should appear, and you can left-click to place it. It also helps with moving vertices.  
-- Cons: It can add a bunch of extra vertices to your model, which can make your model a mess.  
2. F. A shortcut.  
-- Pros: It's really easy-to-use and doesn't add any vertices.  
-- Cons: It isn't able to add any "floating" faces (faces that use only 1 edge).
