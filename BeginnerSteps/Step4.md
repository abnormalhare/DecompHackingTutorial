## Step 4: Blender Tools and Shortcuts
Now that you're through all that set up and preparation, let's get you making a 3D model. There are 2 different ways to make polygons, with different uses:
1. Poly Build. Located on the right when in edit mode, just above the pie chart looking thing (Spin).  
-- Pros: It helps create the triangles we need really easily. Hover near the edge of a previously made object and press `Ctrl`. A triangle should appear, and you can left-click to place it. It also helps with moving vertices
-- Cons: It can add a bunch of extra vertices to your model, which can bog down the N64's performance (real N64 / Emulator with 4MB RAM)
